Welcome! This tutorial will help you using this library to read and create
teeworlds maps.


Load and reading a map
======================

Loading
-------

To load a teeworlds map, simply pass the path (with or without the ``.map``
extension) to the Teemap class. Example:

>>> from tml.tml import Teemap
>>> t = Teemap('dm1')
>>> t = Teemap('dm1.map')

Reading
-------

The structure of the teemap is similiar to the structure you know from the
teeworlds editor, it should be familiar to you.
Example: Getting a list of tiles and their index.

>>> t = Teemap('dm1')
>>> tiles = t.group[5].layers[0].tiles
>>> tiles
<TileManager (3000)>
>>> tiles[0].index
0
>>> tiles[90].index
24

Check out the page ":ref:`examples`" for some impressions what is possible.
For a full list of all methods and attributes, check :class:`tml.tml.Teemap`

Modifying & creating a map from scratch
=======================================

A new Teemap objekt does not contain any layers or groups. To create a
minimalistic, but valid teeworlds map, you need to add one group and a
gamelayer.

>>> from tml.tml import Teemap
>>> from tml.items import Group, TileLayer
>>> t = Teemap()
>>> t.groups
[]
>>> t.groups.append(Group())
>>> t.groups[0].layers
[]
>>> t.groups[0].layers.append(TileLayer(game=True))
>>> t.layers
[<Game layer (50x50)>]
>>> t.groups
[<Group (1)>]
>>> t.save('hello map')

Note that a gamelayer is just a tilelayer with a special ``game flag``

You can at any time call the :meth:`validate <tml.tml.Teemap.validate>`
method, which will return ``True`` if your map is ready to be saved, or raise
an error with information what is wrong with your map.

Managers
--------

For an efficiently memory usage, we do not save the :class:`Tile
<tml.items.Tile>` and :class:`Quad <tml.items.Quad>` objects in simple lists.
There is a huge number of tiles and quads in a average map, saving them as
Tile and Quad objects will eat up your ram. For this reason, we save them as
plain strings. A single tile may look like this:

   ``\x01\x00\x00\x00``

The quads, too, just a bit longer. Nevertheless, we want you to provide a
simple interface, and not give you those ugly strings. This is why we invented
the :class:`Quad- <tml.items.QuadManager` and :class:`TileManager
<tml.items.TileManager`. You can access the tiles through the manager like a
normal list, and the manager will generate a Tile or Quad object for you on the
fly. But keep in mind, that the generate object is **only a copy** of the
string representation of the tile or quad! That means, that you need to
explicity assign the tile, if you changed it! This will NOT work:

  >>> layer.tiles[10].rotate('l')

Instead, do this:

  >>> tile = layer.tiles[10]
  >>> tile.rotate('l')
  >>> layer.tiles[10] = tile

Selecting a subset of a tilelayer
---------------------------------

You can cut out an rectangle of a layer and get a new layer. Use :meth:`select
<tml.items.TileLayer.select>` for that purpose. If you try to select over the
edges of the layer, your values will just be clamped.

  >>> t.gamelayer
  <Game layer (60x50)>
  >>> t.gamelayer.select(20,20,5,10)
  <Game layer (5x10)>
  >>> t.gamelayer.select(10,0,20,42)
  <Game layer (20x42)>
  >>> t.gamelayer.select(50,0,15,5)
  <Game layer (10x5)>
  >>> t.gamelayer.select(70,0,15,5)
  <Game layer (1x5)>


Drawing on a tilelayer
----------------------

Like with the brush in teeworlds, you can draw one tilelayer (the one on the
brush) onto another. Call the draw method of the layer which should get the
tiles from the other one, and give it the x and y coordinates.

>>> destination_layer.draw(20, 10, source_layer)

Resizing a tilelayer
--------------------

Maybe you want to change the size of a tilelayer. Don't worry about adding or
removing tiles from the tilemanager - just set the new width and height of the
layer:

>>> layer.width = 10
>>> layer.height = 200

Internally, the number of tiles in the tilemanager will be changed to fit to
the new size. This is why you should *never* try to add or remove objects
manually from a manager, the layer handles it itself!

Saving a map
============

Saving a map to a file is just as easy as reading it. Just call the
:meth:`save <tml.tml.Teemap.save>` method and give it the path where it
should save the file. You can, but do not need to leave ot the ``.map``
fileextension, it will be added automatically.

>>> teemap.save('/home/tee/my_great_map')
